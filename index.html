    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>
      It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves.
      The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire nervous
      system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that
      would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone
      some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our
      phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with
      phase discriminators.
