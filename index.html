    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <div>
      It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves.
      The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire nervous
      system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that
      would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone
      some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our
      phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with
      phase discriminators.
    </div>

    <h3>Something that defines me</h3>
    <div>
      Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon
      torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must
      have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
      inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
      Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the
      beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.
