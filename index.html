    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Skylar Rogers and I am an aspiring Web Developer currently
      looking for a position to begin an earnest career. I am a Deliverer,
      Philomath, Problem Solver, Peacekeeper, and Coach. I want to use my skills
      to contribute to the exciting advances that happen every day in web
      developing for your company. I am graduating from the Fullstack Academy in
      2023 with a certification in Web Development. While I am in school, I work
      at Amazon and within the first 3 months I took on more responsibility, as
      one of the first selected to become a Safety Ambassador when the program
      first launched, learned ship clerking/data analytics to back up and assist
      in operations, and display the leadership skills I learned as a Team Lead
      at Target. I continue to develop my leadership and web development skills,
      as I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience and skill sets
      to your Team.
    </p>

    <h3>Something that defines me</h3>
    <p>
      Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon
      torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must
      have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
      inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
      Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the
      beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.
