# Personal-Website

The Purpose of this is to create a professional website to showcase my work and skillset as a web developer for persepctive employers.

There will be several branches each representing a part of the development process.
  Coding-
    This will be for pure development all works in progress will go here before being copied into either the Testing or Live branches. 
    Future versions/revisitions will begin the developlment process again here.
  Testing-
    For testing new features before being copied into the Live branch.
    Any sigificant changes in code should be begin in the coding branch before being copied into testing.
  Live-
    Only the live version of the website should be here.
    No changes or revision should be pushed directly into this branch.
    Only interbranch copying should override any code here.
